# **Introduction**

> The drug misuse crisis in Scotland remains one of the **most severe public health challenges in Europe** (McAuley, Matheson, and Robertson, 2022).  

According to Scotland's National Records, substance abuse caused **1,276 recorded deaths in 2023**. At **22.4 fatalities per 100,000**, Scotland's drug death rate far exceeds the **UK's average of 7.6**, reflecting ongoing systemic failures despite recent declines.  

This paper examines **drug misuse trends in Scotland** from 1996 to 2023, focusing on:  
- Geographic, socioeconomic, and gender disparities  
- Policy interventions (e.g., the **2011 reform of reporting standards**)  
- The role of **poly-drug use in fatalities**  

The analysis identifies **temporal trends, disparities, and policy implications** while offering actionable **recommendations** to reduce drug-related deaths in Scotland.

## **Trends in Drug Misuse Over Time**

Drug-related deaths (DRDs) in Scotland rose from **244 in 1996** to a peak of **1,339 in 2020**, before declining slightly to **1,276 in 2023** *(Figure 1)*. These trends reflect the evolving challenges of tackling drug misuse, especially the impact of **benzodiazepines** and **opioids**.

The **COVID-19 pandemic** exacerbated vulnerabilities by disrupting **support services**, increasing **social isolation**, and tripling loneliness for those facing **mental health challenges** (O’Sullivan *et al.*, 2021).

---

### Key Takeaways:
- **Benzodiazepines:** Sharp rise post-2015, particularly street benzos.  
- **Opioids:** Persistent contributors to drug misuse mortality.  
- **Policy Influence:** The **2011 Naloxone Programme** showed measurable impact.  
- **Pandemic Impact:** Increased isolation amplified risks.  

### **Figure 1**: Trends in Drug Misuse Deaths in Scotland by Gender (1996–2023)

- The **dashed navy line** marks a **notable policy change in 2011**, which corresponds to the implementation of the **National Naloxone Programme**.  
- **Male deaths consistently exceeded female deaths**, highlighting gender disparities in drug misuse trends.  
- The **peak in total deaths** occurred in **2020**, with both genders contributing to the surge.  
- Post-2020, a **slight decline** in drug-related deaths has been observed, but the numbers remain alarmingly high.  

**Key takeaway:** Gender-specific vulnerabilities must be addressed to tackle the crisis effectively. While men are disproportionately affected, the systemic barriers faced by women—such as stigma and caregiving stress—must also be addressed.

```

**Note:** The **policy change in 2011** aligns with the introduction of Scotland’s **National Naloxone Programme**, a critical intervention in reducing opioid-related fatalities.  

### **Figure 2**: Trends in Drug Misuse Deaths in Scotland by Substance Group (1996–2023)

- **Benzodiazepines** showed a **dramatic rise post-2015**, becoming the **leading contributor to drug misuse deaths** by 2020.  
- **Opioid-related deaths** have shown **persistent increases**, further driving Scotland’s alarming drug death rates.  
- **Deaths involving stimulants and other substances** remained relatively lower but have exhibited **steady growth** over the years.  

**Key takeaway:** The emergence of high-potency illicit substances such as **‘street benzos’** highlights the importance of **tailored interventions** and **enhanced harm reduction strategies** to mitigate the crisis.

In **2022**, **men accounted for 73% of drug-related deaths (DRDs)**, reflecting higher engagement in **intravenous and poly-drug use** (Gossop *et al.*, 1994; Gjersing and Helle, 2021). The rise of **‘street benzos,’** characterised by **high potency and unknown composition**, has disproportionately impacted male users (McAuley *et al.*, 2022).  

**Women**, however, face distinct vulnerabilities, including:  
- **Caregiving stress**  
- **Domestic abuse**  
- **Stigma**, compounded by welfare system changes (Tweed *et al.*, 2022)  

These disparities demand **gender-sensitive harm reduction strategies** that address structural inequities.  

The **2011 policy change**, which introduced new reporting procedures, marks a pivotal point in the timeline. Scotland implemented a **National Naloxone Programme** in 2011, which was associated with a **36% reduction in opioid-related deaths** within four weeks of prison release.  
- Specifically, the proportion of prison-release opioid-related deaths fell from **9.8% pre-2011** to **6.3% by 2013**, demonstrating the program's significant impact (Bird *et al.*, 2016).  

However, **general practitioners** showed limited awareness and involvement in naloxone distribution, citing:  
1. A need for **evidence of effectiveness**  
2. The necessity for **appropriate training** (Matheson *et al.*, 2014)  

These findings highlight the **complex interplay** of socioeconomic factors, healthcare services, and targeted interventions in addressing Scotland's DRD crisis. They emphasise the importance of both **structural changes** and **specific measures** like naloxone distribution in comprehensive drug policy.  

**Critically**, the **persistent rise in deaths prior to 2011** underscores Scotland’s failure to address root causes such as:  
- **Socio-economic deprivation**  
- **Inadequate mental health services**  

This trend highlights the need for **proactive policies** that address **structural inequities** alongside **reactive measures** like naloxone distribution.  

---

## **Causes of Drug Misuse Deaths**  

**Accidental poisoning** emerged as the **leading cause of death post-2011** (Figure 3), driven by the rising prevalence of **synthetic opioids**, which are **50–100 times more potent than morphine** (Thompson *et al.*, 2021).  

These substances, often combined with **benzodiazepines**, are implicated in over **60% of drug-related deaths**, highlighting the dangers of **poly-drug use** (McAuley *et al.*, 2022).  

**Key takeaway:** This increase reflects not only shifts in drug supply but also **systemic shortcomings** in prevention and intervention strategies.  

---

### **Figure 3**: Trends in Drug Misuse Deaths by Cause Over Time (1996–2023)

- The **dashed line** marks the division between **pre- and post-2011 periods**, following changes in reporting practices.  
- **Accidental poisoning** has become the **leading cause of death post-2011**, while deaths attributed to **mental disorders** have decreased significantly, likely reflecting shifts in classification methods.

### **Figure 4**: Drug Misuse Deaths Over Time by Cause (Pre- and Post-2011)

The **navy dashed line** indicates the **2011 policy change** impacting reporting practices.  
- **Accidental poisoning** became the **leading cause of death post-2011**, while deaths attributed to **mental disorders** decreased significantly.  
- Other categories, including **self-poisoning**, **undetermined deaths**, and **assault**, exhibit less consistent trends, highlighting the **multifaceted nature** of drug-related mortality in Scotland.

```

Self-poisoning and deaths of **undetermined intent**, also visualised in **Figure 4**, highlight the **intersection between drug misuse and mental health crises**. Scotland’s failure to **integrate mental health and addiction services** exacerbates these risks, leaving vulnerable individuals without adequate support.  

Furthermore, there appears to be a **growing role of poly-drug use**, which complicates prevention efforts.  
- **Polydrug use** contributes to **over 70% of deaths** (**Figure 5**), significantly increasing the risk of fatal interactions.  
- This dominance of poly-drug use reveals **shortcomings in current treatment models**, which often address **single-substance dependency** rather than the **interplay of multiple drugs** (Ives and Ghelani, 2006).  

---

### **Figure 5**: Single-Drug vs. Poly-Drug Deaths in 2023  

- **Poly-drug deaths** accounted for **73.7% (864)** of total drug-related deaths, highlighting the **complexity and heightened risks** associated with substance interactions.  
- **Single-drug deaths** represented **26.3% (308)** of the total, underscoring the **need for interventions targeting poly-drug use specifically**.

Addressing these causes requires **interventions that extend beyond harm reduction**.  

- The widespread use of **methadone for opioid dependency**, dispensed by **79.1% of pharmacies in 2006**, demonstrates a commitment to harm reduction.  
- However, the **lack of progress in needle exchange services** remains a **significant gap** in addressing drug misuse effectively.  

---

## **Socioeconomic Disparities**  

**Socioeconomic deprivation** is a key driver of drug misuse deaths in Scotland:  

- Individuals in the **most deprived quintile (SIMD 1)** experience **death rates up to eight times higher** than those in the **least deprived quintile (SIMD 5)**.  
- Factors such as the **affordability and accessibility of 'street benzos'** in deprived areas exacerbate this crisis (McAuley *et al.*, 2022).  

**Addressing these disparities requires structural reforms** to ensure:  
1. **Equitable funding** for harm reduction services.  
2. **Improved access** to essential interventions in the most deprived areas.  

---

### **Figure 6**: Drug Misuse Deaths Over Time by SIMD Quintile (2000–2023)  

- **Age-standardized rates** highlight stark disparities:  
  - Individuals in the **most deprived quintile (SIMD 1)** consistently experience the **highest rates** of drug misuse deaths.  
  - In contrast, the **least deprived quintile (SIMD 5)** shows **significantly lower rates**, underscoring the **impact of socioeconomic inequalities**.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Addressing the stark **socioeconomic disparities** requires **prioritizing harm reduction services** in the most deprived communities. Policies should specifically target barriers to access, including:  
- **Affordability** of services.  
- **Stigma** associated with drug misuse.  
- **Equitable distribution** of harm reduction services.  

---

The funding formula used by **NHS Scotland Boards** and **Alcohol and Drug Partnerships (ADPs)** has disproportionately impacted deprived communities, leading to:  
- **Increased Drug-Related Death (DRD) rates** (McPhee and Sheridan, 2020).  
- Limited participation of pharmacies in **needle exchange programs** due to:  
  - **Safety concerns.**  
  - Perceived impact on **customer relationships.**  

Despite modest improvements, only **12.5% of Scottish pharmacies** provided needle exchange services as of 2006, reflecting the **persistent challenges** in achieving equitable service distribution (Matheson, Bond, and Tinelli, 2007).

### **Figure 7**: Drug Misuse Deaths Over Time by SIMD Decile (2000–2023)  

- **Age-standardized rates** reveal stark inequalities:  
  - The **most deprived decile (1)** consistently experiences the **highest rates** of drug misuse deaths, peaking in 2020.  
  - In contrast, the **least deprived decile (10)** shows **consistently low rates** throughout the period.  
  - These trends highlight the **socioeconomic gradient** in drug misuse mortality and the **urgent need for targeted interventions**.

Policy responses have been **inadequate** in addressing the **structural drivers** of drug misuse. Critiques of the governance of drug and alcohol services since 2009 emphasize the following issues:  
- **Widened inequalities** due to funding decisions.  
- Disproportionate **risks for already vulnerable communities** (McPhee and Sheridan, 2020).  

Governance failures undermine efforts to tackle the **systemic drivers** of drug misuse and drug-related deaths (DRDs). Key challenges include:  
- Concentration of **needle exchange services** in urban areas, limited further by:  
  - **Stigma**.  
  - **Resource constraints** (Matheson, Bond, and Tinelli, 2007) (Childs *et al.*, 2021).  

**Addressing these disparities** requires:  
- Investments in **affordable housing**.  
- Initiatives for **job creation**.  
- Development of **integrated, community-based health services**.  

---

## **Geographic Patterns**  

**Geographic differences** in drug misuse reflect Scotland’s uneven distribution of **social and health resources**:  

- **Rural areas**, which accounted for only **18.1% of surveyed pharmacies** in 2006, face **significant limitations** in harm reduction service availability.  
  - This underscores the **need for targeted interventions** to bridge geographic disparities in service provision (Matheson, Bond, and Tinelli, 2007).  

- **Urban areas** like Glasgow experience **higher rates of drug deaths** due to the intersection of:  
  - **Homelessness**.  
  - **Poverty**.  
  - **Social exclusion** (Figure 8).  

- In contrast, **rural areas** report lower rates but encounter challenges like:  
  - **Geographic isolation**.  
  - **Limited harm reduction services** (Bailey, Bramley, and Gannon, 2016).

### **Figure 8**: Total Drug Misuse Deaths by Health Board Area in Scotland (2010–2023)  

- The map illustrates **geographic disparities** in drug misuse deaths:  
  - **Urban areas**, particularly **Greater Glasgow and Clyde**, exhibit the **highest concentration** of deaths, shown in dark blue.  
  - **Rural and less densely populated regions** report significantly lower totals.  
  - These trends emphasize **regional inequalities** in drug misuse mortality.

Expanding harm reduction services in **high-risk regions** like Glasgow, such as **mobile units** or **supervised injection sites**, can help reduce the geographic disparity in drug-related deaths.  

Critically, the **allocation of resources** has not aligned with regional needs. Due to Glasgow’s **high mortality rates** (Figure 8), funding for harm reduction services in the area has been **insufficient to meet demand** (Tweed *et al.*, 2018).  
- The **expansion of mobile harm reduction units** and **supervised injection facilities** could address some of these disparities.  
- By doing so, Scotland would be one step closer to ensuring its vulnerable populations have access to **life-saving interventions**.  

---

## **Poly-Drug Use vs. Single-Drug Use**  

- Over **70% of drug-related deaths in 2023** were linked to **poly-drug use** (Figure 5).  
- Current treatment models, which focus on **single-substance dependencies**, are **inadequate**.  

### Key Issues and Risks  
1. **Poly-drug users** frequently use **benzodiazepines**, particularly **etizolam**, which is implicated in fatal overdoses.  
   - Only **1% of deaths** involved **etizolam alone** (McAuley *et al.*, 2022).  
2. The combination of substances, especially **benzodiazepines and opioids**, dramatically increases the **risk of fatal overdose** (Boon *et al.*, 2020).  

### Interventions Needed  
- **Expand detoxification and rehabilitation programs** that address interactions between multiple substances.  
- **Improve education** on the risks of poly-drug use.  
  - Distribute **naloxone** alongside targeted **public health campaigns** to warn of the risks associated with combining substances.  

---

## **Policy Implications and Recommendations**  

### Expanding Harm Reduction Services  
- Invest in **supervised injection sites**, **mobile harm reduction units**, and **needle exchange programs**.  

### Addressing Systemic Inequities  
- Implement **equitable funding** for deprived regions.  
- Integrate **mental health** and **addiction services**.  

### Targeted Public Health Campaigns  
- Promote **education** on the risks of poly-drug use.  
- Expand **naloxone distribution programs** and training initiatives.  

---

# **Conclusion**  

Scotland’s drug misuse deaths result from a complex interplay of **socioeconomic, behavioural, and policy failures**. Over the past three decades, systemic shortcomings have fuelled one of Europe’s **highest drug-related death rates**.  

### Key Challenges   
1. **Persistent poverty** and **untreated mental health crises**.  
2. **Inadequate harm reduction services**.  
3. Governance failures and **inequitable funding practices** (McPhee and Sheridan, 2020).  

### Recommendations    
- **Sustained investment** in harm reduction strategies.  
- **Structural reforms** to ensure equitable access to services.  
- Integration of **mental health and addiction care**.  

The success of the **National Naloxone Programme** demonstrates the potential of **targeted, well-funded interventions** to reduce high-risk mortality (Bird *et al.*, 2016).  
- However, such efforts must be scaled and complemented by broader **public health initiatives** that prioritise **prevention, equity, and long-term community resilience**.  

By adopting a **proactive, equity-focused approach**, Scotland can pave the way for lasting systemic change, ultimately **saving lives** and improving **community resilience**.
